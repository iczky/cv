      I am a team-oriented worker who constantly seeks to expand my expertise
      and enjoys collaborating and sharing knowledge with others. I have
      experience creating a model object detection using TensorFlow and YOLO to
      predict the maturity level of oil palm fruit. Furthermore, I honed my
      analytics skills by joining the Full Stack Data Analytics program at
      RevoU, where I gained new skills such as analytic thinking about business
      problems, the ability to query business questions using SQL, data
      visualization, and analysis methods like segmentation, clustering, and
      forecasting. As a collaborative and proactive professional, I am dedicated
      to using my skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions and
      achieve their goals.
